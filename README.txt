note (2/14/20):
    I didn't realize that we were supposed to log our activity during the duration of coding on the readme, so points2.h is all a recap.
points2.h
    I completed all of points2.h. After submissions I realized I had an error with move constructor.
    I needed to clear the size_ and sequence_ data from rhs.
    probably the most difficulty I had with this assignment was add constructor, 
    but I was able to fix that by adding a function which would allow me to change the read only variables sequence_ and size_. 
    after creating this function I realized it could be helpful for other sections in the project as well, but the + operator was the last bit I worked on.

Permute
    at the time of date due I had not submitted permute, but will work on permute today 2/14/20. I will keep notes this time
    completed permute.h. 
    took about 5 hours to figure out an algorithm that would be easy to code (several were found, but none easy to implement)
    coding took abt an hr.
    note: I could have looked this up easily and found an algorithm but I wanted to find one by hand cause it was kinda fun
